# Kubernetes Labs – KodeKloud

This repository contains my hands-on introduction to Kubernetes through **KodeKloud labs**. It documents key activities, practical skills, and my personal reflections while exploring core cluster administration concepts.

Notably, I have added **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) takeaways** for each lab as my own initiative, connecting technical Kubernetes exercises to best practices in security, operational risk management, and compliance. This demonstrates both technical mastery and awareness of risk-aware operational practices.

## Labs Covered

- **Familiarize with Kubernetes** – Explored the KodeKloud cluster environment and practiced core `kubectl` commands to navigate namespaces and inspect resources.  
- **Kubernetes Pods** – Created and managed Pods using YAML manifests to understand Kubernetes’ fundamental workload unit and container lifecycles.  
- **Kubernetes ReplicaSets** – Configured ReplicaSets to maintain desired pod counts, enabling automatic scaling and self-healing for high availability.  
- **Kubernetes Deployments** – Managed application lifecycles with Deployments, performing rolling updates and ensuring declarative, version-controlled rollouts.  
- **Kubernetes Rolling & Rollback Updates** – Executed rolling updates for zero-downtime releases and performed safe rollbacks to previous versions when issues arose.  
- **Kubernetes Services** – Exposed applications internally and externally using ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services, and explored service discovery through DNS.

## Repository Structure

- **writeup_1.md … writeup_4.md** – Detailed documentation of each lab, including objectives, key activities, outcomes, and personal GRC takeaways.  
- **evidence/** – Screenshots and supporting evidence for the labs.

This repository demonstrates **foundational Kubernetes skills**—covering workload management, scaling, rolling updates, service exposure, and cluster troubleshooting—**enhanced by GRC-focused insights** to illustrate risk-aware operational thinking.  

It serves as both a technical reference and a portfolio project showing initiative, problem-solving, and an understanding of compliance considerations in real-world Kubernetes operations.
