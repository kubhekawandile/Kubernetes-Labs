# Kubernetes Labs – KodeKloud

This repository contains my hands-on introduction to Kubernetes through KodeKloud labs. It documents key activities and practical skills gained while exploring core cluster administration concepts.


## Labs Covered
- **Familiarize with Kubernetes** – Explored the KodeKloud cluster environment and practiced core `kubectl` commands to navigate namespaces and inspect resources.
- **Kubernetes Pods** – Created and managed Pods using YAML manifests to understand Kubernetes’ fundamental workload unit and container lifecycles.
- **Kubernetes ReplicaSets** – Configured ReplicaSets to maintain desired pod counts, enabling automatic scaling and self-healing for high availability.
- **Kubernetes Deployments** – Managed application lifecycles with Deployments, performing rolling updates and ensuring declarative, version-controlled rollouts.
- **Kubernetes Rolling & Rollback Updates** – Executed rolling updates for zero-downtime releases and performed safe rollbacks to previous versions when issues arose.
- **Kubernetes Services** – Exposed applications internally and externally using ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services, and explored service discovery through DNS.


## Repository Structure
- **writeup.md** – Detailed documentation of the labs, objectives, and outcomes.  
- **evidence/** – Screenshots supporting the completed exercises.  

This repository demonstrates foundational Kubernetes skills—covering workload management, scaling, updates, and service exposure—built entirely through interactive labs on the **KodeKloud** platform.
