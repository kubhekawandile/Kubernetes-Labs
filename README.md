# Kubernetes Labs – KodeKloud

This repository documents my completion of a series of interactive Kubernetes labs on KodeKloud, covering the essential building blocks of cluster administration.

## Labs Covered
- **Familiarize with Kubernetes** – Explored the KodeKloud cluster environment and practiced core `kubectl` commands to navigate namespaces and inspect resources.
- **Kubernetes Pods** – Created and managed pods using YAML manifests to understand Kubernetes’ fundamental workload unit.
- **Kubernetes ReplicaSets** – Configured ReplicaSets to maintain desired pod counts and provide high availability through automatic scaling and self-healing.
- **Kubernetes Deployments** – Managed application lifecycles with Deployments, performing updates and ensuring declarative, version-controlled rollouts.
- **Kubernetes Rolling & Rollback Updates** – Executed rolling updates for zero-downtime releases and performed safe rollbacks to previous versions when issues arose.
- **Kubernetes Services** – Exposed applications internally and externally using ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services, and explored service discovery through DNS.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Kubernetes resource management with `kubectl`
- YAML-based declarative configuration
- Scaling and maintaining high availability
- Rolling upgrades and controlled rollbacks
- Networking and service discovery

All labs were completed on the [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com) platform to gain hands-on experience with real Kubernetes clusters.
